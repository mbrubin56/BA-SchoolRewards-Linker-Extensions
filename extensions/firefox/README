The Firefox extension was originally generated using Greasemonkey.  I then used the Greasemonkey
compiler at https://arantius.com/misc/greasemonkey/script-compiler.php to produce 
an extension that does not require Greasemonkey.  To generate a new version of the extension, do the
following:
* cd into the directory rittanacresamazonschoolrewardsl
* run zip -r brittanacresamazonschoolrewardsl.zip ./*
* mv brittanacresamazonschoolrewardsl.zip brittanacresamazonschoolrewardsl.xpi
* mv brittanacresamazonschoolrewardsl.xpi ../

This will create a zip file, rename the zip file with the xpi extension that Firefox expects
for extensions, and then move the file up a directory.
