The Firefox extension was originally generated using Greasemonkey.  I then used the Greasemonkey compiler at https://arantius.com/misc/greasemonkey/script-compiler.php to produce  an extension that does not require Greasemonkey.  To generate a new version of the extension, do the following:
* cd into the directory brittanacresamazonschoolrewardsl
* zip -r schoolrewards.zip ./*
* mv schoolrewards.zip ../

This will create a zip file, rename the zip file with the xpi extension that Firefox expects for extensions, and then move the file up a directory.

Updating the extension is tricky, because it requires that you sign the update.rdf using the same private key
as used to generate the public key in the install.rdf.  To generate the key and to sign, 
I used https://developer.mozilla.org/en/McCoy

Here are the steps:
* Update the install.rdf with the new version
* Create the xpi using the zip technique above
* Get the sha1 sum of the xpi file (e.g. sha1sum schoolrewards.xpi)
* In the firefoxupdate.rdf file, replace the sha1 sum there with the new sum
* Use McCoy to sign the firefoxupdate.rdf file
* Upload the firefoxupdate.rdf and new xpi files
* Test the upload by going to the extension in Firefox, setting it to automatically update, and use the cog menu to check for updates.
To debug, it's useful to run Firefox from the command line with the -console option (e.g. Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox -console)
