This project contains two extensions -- one for Firefox and one for Chrome -- that automatically tack on to www.amazon.com urls the query string parameter "tag=britacreelem-20", thus ensuring that purchases on Amazon are credited to Brittan Acres' account in the Amazon SchoolRewards program.  Although people often bookmark such links, they often forget to use that bookmark when shopping at Amazon (at least I did!).  So now with the extensions installed, people never have to remember to use the bookmark or add on the query string parameter manually: the extensions always do it for you.

Note that if you browse to an Amazon url and you already have a "tag=<some value>" query string parameter, the extension will respect that and not change it.  Thus, if you participate in multiple  rewards programs, you can consciously choose to use an Amazon link that participates in one that isn't Brittan Acre's School Rewards program.
